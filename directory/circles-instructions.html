        <h2>So, why use Circles and not another messaging app?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Circles is automatically organized based on church records so it is easy to message everyone as long as they have the app and have signed in.</li>
          <li>You can easily avoid violating any handbook guidelines (e.g. privately messaging a youth) because these restrictions are built into the app.</li>
          <li>You can avoid any cross platform friction that some phones introduce when trying to make group chats.</li>
          <li>Planning activities and sharing goals are built right into the messenger making it easy for everyone to see.</li>
