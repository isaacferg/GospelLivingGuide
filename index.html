        <h3>What is the Gospel Living App?</h3>
        <p>The Living App connects to your church records to organize features based on your information. For example, it automatically adds you to your quorum, class, and calling group messages in the Circle section and alerts you if any events are made concerning your groups in the Activities section.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="faq-item">
        <h3>How can I add someone to my quorum, class, or calling group message in Circles?</h3>
        <p>The Living App uses information from church records to automatically organize group messages for quorums, classes, and callings. Unfortunately, users are unable to directly add or remove anyone from Circle group messages. If you're having trouble adding someone, the first thing to check is their official calling in the church's system.</p>

        <h3>I'm having trouble logging in.</h3>
        <p>In order to login, you'll need to verify your login information in at churchofjesuschrist.org and perhaps change your password if needed. All account information for The Living App is pulled directly from the church's records information.</p>

      <article class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I update my profile information?</h3>
        <p>You can update your profile by going to the settings page in the app, selecting "Account," then selecting the three dots in the top corner, and choosing the item you want to change. Much more information can be changed through the church's online system. Contact your ward or branch Clerk for access to more information.</p>
